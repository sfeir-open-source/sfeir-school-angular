# Module Bundlers in Angular: Webpack

Before Angular 16, under the hood, Angular used Webpack to build our application

##==##

# What is Webpack?

- JavaScript bundler that takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets <br/><br/>
- Key features:
  - Code splitting for optimized loading
  - Tree shaking to remove unused code
  - Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for faster development
  - Development server with live reload
  - Plugin system for extensive customization
  - Asset management (images, fonts, etc.)

##==##

# How Webpack Works in Angular

- Webpack is used to bundle and optimize the application code <br/><br/>
- It takes the Angular components, services, and other modules as input <br/><br/>
- Webpack then processes the code, applying optimizations and transformations as needed <br/><br/>
- The resulting bundle is then loaded by the browser, allowing the application to run

# Module Bundlers in Angular: Vite

Following Angular 16, Vite is now available as an alternative to Webpack and in v20 the default module bundler

##==##

# What is Vite?

- A modern build tool that provides a faster and more efficient way to build and serve applications <br/><br/>
- Key features:
  - Native ES modules support
  - Faster development server
  - Better TypeScript support
  - Modern tooling
  - Simpler configuration

##==##

# How Vite Works in Angular

- Vite uses the Angular compiler to compile the application code <br/><br/>
- It then serves the compiled code using a development server <br/><br/>
- Vite also provides a production build process that optimizes the code for deployment <br/><br/>
- The resulting bundle is then loaded by the browser, allowing the application to run

# Vite vs Webpack

| Feature           | Webpack    | Vite      |
| ----------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Development Speed | Good       | Excellent |
| Build Time        | Good       | Excellent |
| Configuration     | Complex    | Simple    |
| ESM Support       | Transpiled | Native    |
| HMR Speed         | Good       | Instant   |

# When to Use Which?

- Webpack:
  - Legacy projects
  - Complex configurations
  - Enterprise applications
  - Need for extensive plugins <br/><br/>
- Vite:
  - New projects
  - Modern JavaScript
  - Faster development
  - Simpler setup
  - Native ESM support

##==##

# Migration Tips

- Vite requires modern browsers <br/><br/>
- Some Webpack plugins may not work <br/><br/>
- Configuration is simpler but different <br/><br/>
- Performance gains are significant <br/><br/>
- Development experience is smoother <br/><br/>

##==##

# Best Practices

- Choose bundler based on project needs <br/><br/>
- Keep configuration minimal <br/><br/>
- Use modern JavaScript features <br/><br/>
- Leverage development tools <br/><br/>
- Monitor build performance <br/><br/>
- Keep dependencies updated

##==##

# Performance Tips

- Use code splitting <br/><br/>
- Implement lazy loading <br/><br/>
- Optimize assets <br/><br/>
- Use modern JavaScript <br/><br/>
- Monitor bundle size <br/><br/>
- Use production builds for deployment

##==##

# Troubleshooting

- Check browser compatibility <br/><br/>
- Verify configuration <br/><br/>
- Monitor build warnings <br/><br/>
- Use appropriate plugins <br/><br/>
- Keep dependencies updated <br/><br/>
- Test thoroughly before deployment
