# A control flow directly in the framework

Since Angular 17, Angular's control flow is an integral part of the framework and the templating compiler:
<br/><br/>

- increased performance <br/><br/>
- removal of NgIf, NgFor, NgSwitch imports<br/><br/>
- lighter bundle

# The new @-block syntax for control flow

- Replaces the old `*` microsyntax for structural directives. <br/><br/>
- Provides a cleaner, more intuitive, and powerful way to manage control flow. <br/><br/>
- The `let` keyword and implicit context variables (`$implicit`) are no longer needed in the same way.
