# A quick word on Material Design

- The lab uses Material Design components (mat-toolbar, mat-checkbox, mat-card ...)<br/><br/>
- This training does not focus on Material Design, nor on Angular Material directives<br/><br/>
- Your projects are not required to use Material Design<br/><br/>
Notes:
- Material Design is a set of Design guidelines established by Google. This design consists of spacing our components and making them more 'rounded'
- There are many other design frameworks:
 - materialize
 - bootstrap / ng-bootstrap
