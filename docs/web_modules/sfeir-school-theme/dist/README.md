# SFEIR School Theme

You can preview it here : https://sfeir-school-theme.netlify.app/

- [Releases Notes](https://github.com/sfeir-open-source/sfeir-school-theme/wiki/Releases-Notes)

# How to use it:

## Npm

```sh
# run
$npm install sfeir-school-theme
```

## Cloning the repo

Let's consider that the path to reveal engine is at `$LIBS_PATH`

Clone the repository in your project (`$SFEIR_THEME_PATH`)

## Link

You should have a folder `web_modules/sfeir-school-theme`. In this folder you should have the bundled sfeir theme (either copy the demo web_modules or build it with `npm run build`).

In your index.html add the following lines:

```html
...
<head>
    ...
    <!-- SFEIR Theme includes -->
    <script type="module" src="./scripts/slides.js"></script>
    <link
        rel="stylesheet"
        type="text/css"
        href="./web_modules/sfeir-school-theme/dist/sfeir-school-theme.css"
        id="theme" />
</head>
<body>
    <div class="reveal">
        <!-- Any section element inside of this container is displayed as a slide -->
        <div class="slides" data-type-show="prez"></div>
    </div>
</body>
...
```

and a basic `slides.js`:

```JavaScript
import { SfeirThemeInitializer } from "../web_modules/sfeir-school-theme/dist/sfeir-school-theme.mjs";

// One method per module
function schoolSlides(typeShow) {
  return [
    "00_intro.md",
    "01_speaker.md",
    "10_chapter1.md",
    "11_layouts.md",
    "15_vertical.md",
    "20_specifics_slides.md",
    "30_code_slides.md",
    "40_helpers.md",
    "50_modes.md",
  ];
}

function formation(typeShow) {
  return [
    //
    ...schoolSlides(typeShow),
  ].map((slidePath) => {
    return { path: slidePath };
  });
}

SfeirThemeInitializer.init(formation);
```

Enjoy!

## Play with mode theme

Lots of trainings given by SFEIR School program are also available with the paid program SFEIR Institute (training organism of SFEIR company). The program SFEIR School has a main theme color which is green whereas SFEIR Institute has a main theme color which is blue. To use the same support for both programs, V3 makes it possible to switch easily from one theme to another.

To this end, you have two possibilities:

- Use HTML attribute `data-theme`;
- Use URL parameter `data-theme`.

Below are `index.html` and URL examples for the available themes.

1. **[Institute](https://sfeir-school-theme.netlify.app?data-theme=institute)**

```html
<body>
    <div class="reveal">
        <div class="slides" data-theme="institute">...</div>
    </div>
</body>
```

https://sfeir-school-theme.netlify.app/index.html?data-theme=institute#/

2. **[School](https://sfeir-school-theme.netlify.app/index.html#/)** (default theme)

```html
<body>
    <div class="reveal">
        <div class="slides" data-theme="school">...</div>
    </div>
</body>
```

https://sfeir-school-theme.netlify.app/index.html?data-theme=school#/

3. **[Conf](https://sfeir-school-theme.netlify.app?data-theme=conf)**

```html
<body>
    <div class="reveal">
        <div class="slides" data-theme="conf">...</div>
    </div>
</body>
```

https://sfeir-school-theme.netlify.app/index.html?data-theme=conf#/

The default value is "school" mode -> Green theme.

Here is an example of first slide according to if you set mode to institute or not.

### Institute mode :

![](./docs/images/first-slide-institute.png)

### Conf mode :

![](./docs/images/first-slide-conf.png)

### Normal mode (or school mode):

![](./docs/images/first-slide.png)

Here are the impacts of the mode :

- Change the first slide
- If you use SFEIR background (`transition-bg-sfeir-1` to `transition-bg-sfeir-3`), the background use will be green or blue
- The underline of titles in transitions slides
- The exercice slide
- The color of feather icons
- The header of tables

## I18N your slides

If you want to translate your slides, you simply have to add the extension corresponding to the translate langage : `XX-slide.EN.md`.

The default langage used is French, so by default a file with no extension or when you ask french slides, the engine provides you the markdown files without lang suffix.

If your asking a slide that is not available in the asked langage, the engine will provide you the "default" langage slide.

To resume, asking `FR` langage will serve you default markdown files.

To specify the langage you want to use, you have two options :

- define the langage in the index.html
- adding a parameter specifying the langage

### Configuration in the index.html

```html
<body>
    <div class="reveal">
        <div class="slides" data-lang="EN">...</div>
    </div>
</body>
```

### Configuration by URL

Simply add a query parameter in the URL `data-lang` with the wanted langage after.

## Specifics Slides

<br>

### C'est l'heure de la pause

<br>

![](pause-circle 'tc-icons feather')<!-- .element: style="--tc-icon-size:300px; --tc-icon-color:var(--light-grey);" -->

<br>

On se retrouve √†

<!-- .element: class="center" -->
<br>

![](clock 'tc-icons feather tc-big')<!-- .element: style="--tc-icon-color:var(--light-grey);" --> 10h
```

![](./docs/images/blur-slide.png)

## Exercices

To produce exercices slides:

```md
<!-- .slide: class="exercice" -->

# Exercice Title

## Exercice

<br>
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
<br>
Additionnal Advice
### Step: push-1
```

![](./docs/images/exercice-slide.png)

### Create content for the restitution only

With this configuration option you can easily create content that is different between, what you will play on stage and what you will give to your attendees without a complete rewrite of your slides. This configuration is a pair between a key specified in your index.html or URL parameters and a key present in your slides.

**Index.html Configuration**

```html
<body>
    <div class="reveal">
        <div class="slides" data-type="prez">...</div>
    </div>
</body>
```

https://sfeir-school-theme.netlify.app/index.html?data-type=prez#/

**Slides configuration**

```markdown
<!-- .slide: data-type-show="prez" -->

## A slide for prez only

A few words !
```

The slide 'A slide for prez only' will be visible only if the attribute `data-type-show` on index.html is set to "prez" or if the type URL parameter is set to prez.
Note that as for the themes described above, the URL parameter takes precedence over the HTML attribute.

With this technique, you can easily create 2 versions of your index.hml, one with `data-type-show` to **prez** and one with `data-type-show`to **full** and in your slides, you have something like that

```markdown
<!-- .slide: data-type-show="prez" -->

## A slide for prez only

A few words !

##==##

<!-- .slide: data-type-show="full" -->

## A slide for publication only

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin nec risus leo. Vestibulum condimentum orci in urna auctor aliquet. Quisque mi erat, placerat non porttitor ut, gravida eu erat. Fusce semper ipsum vel nibh porttitor aliquam. Cras sed porttitor est, id scelerisque odio. Pellentesque sit amet imperdiet ex. Aliquam erat.
```

If nothing is set in the markdown, the slide will be available for both versions.

You can also set multiples data-type-show in the same slide (separated by a space) to create kind of specifics configurations for your slides.

```markdown
<!-- .slide: data-type-show="prez other" -->
```
